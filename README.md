# Netgear Web Console automation
***
## Why? For fun mostly but also:
I have multiple netgear consumer network devices. They work great but do not offer any automation or cloud management features.
I'm building this tool enable monitoring, and automation features for my devices.
I used python and selenium to create action/goal specific functions for this tool.
The script currently runs with a console menu for testing while I build the functions, currently it only has options for retrieving configuration files from different devices.
## Planned functionality 
The planed uses for this include: 
- automated configuration backups
- automated configuration change detection and alerts
- automated configuration pushes
- log retrieval/archiving
- Lists of Connected Devices Ip, MAC,ect
- Firmware update automation.
## Requirements
- Python and selenium
